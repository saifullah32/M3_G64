## INTRODUCTION :-

A smart entry system is an electronic lock that controls access to a vehicle without using a traditional mechanical key. The term keyless entry system originally meant a lock controlled by a keypad located at or near the driver's door, which required entering a predetermined (or self-programmed) numeric code. Such systems now have a hidden touch-activated keypad.
The term remote keyless Entry (RKE), also called  remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.

## RESARCH :-

One of the first introductions was in 1980 on the Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Cougar, Lincoln Continental Mark VI, and Lincoln Town Car, which Ford called Keyless Entry System (later renamed SecuriCode). It was a keypad on the driver-side exterior door above the door handle. It consisted of a keypad with five buttons that when the code was entered, would unlock the driver's door, with subsequent code entries to unlock all doors, and the trunk. Nissan offered the same technology on the Nissan Maxima and Nissan Fairlady beginning in 1984, essentially using the same approach as Ford, with the addition of being able to roll the windows down and open the optional moonroof from outside the vehicle on the door handle installed keypad on both the driver's and front passengers door.

## FEATURES :-

* When the button is pressed ONCE, the car will be locked.
* When the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be unlocked.
* When the button is pressed THREE times, it will activate or deactivate the alarm.
* When the button is pressed FOUR times, it will approach light.
